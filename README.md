# Awesome Gain Maps

Links, discussion threads, [example images](https://github.com/NMoroney/awesome-gain-maps/tree/main/images) and libraries related to HDR using gain mapped JPEGs. This repository started as a collection of links and papers about color HDR. Then after CIC32 it accumulated applications and images from a parallel 30 day challenge on gain maps. Now it's a combination of these threads, a work in progress and a range of samples including photography, video games, visualization and test targets.

There is also a multi-page Streamlit app (that includes an HDR color picker) available for in-person demonstration. An SDR (ie non-gain mapped) screenshot jpg of this application is below. A gain mapped version of this astronomy image is [here](images/gain_mapped-photo-laser_milky_way.jpg) :

<img src="images/2503-hdr_multipage_app-01.jpg" width=400px>

The gain mapped JPGs have been validated using a MacBook Pro M3 (Sonoma 14.6.1) display and the Brave Browser (1.76.73). The Streamlit [dark mode](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/configuration/theming) is used for the demo app and a comparable viewing condition may be preferred when viewing the example gain mapped jpegs.
